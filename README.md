- Built a game in Java where each player connects a path from one side to the opposite side
- Applied Breadth First Search to figure out which player wins the game

Plan to improve the code
- Instead of using tester jar, using JUnit to test the method
- Using access modifiers to keep codes from users
- Instead of using only one class to implement the game, modularize the code to make clean and readable
